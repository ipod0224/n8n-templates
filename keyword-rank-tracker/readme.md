## Overview

This repository provides a free rank tracker that allows you to track unlimited keywords for as many websites as you like. It automates the process of keyword rank tracking, saving you time and effort compared to manual checks or expensive SEO tools.

## Why Use This Template?

Most SEO tools for rank tracking are:

This automation solves these problems by providing unlimited tracking capabilities for free.

### Google Spreadsheets Setup
